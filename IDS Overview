This project involves the development of a cross-platform Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python. The IDS monitors real-time network traffic, captures, and analyzes packets to detect potential security threats based on predefined suspicious IP addresses and ports. Detected anomalies are logged with timestamps in an Excel sheet for future analysis. This project is designed to run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It helps enhance network security by detecting unauthorized access attempts and providing a means for continuous monitoring.
